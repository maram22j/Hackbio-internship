# Hackbio internship:
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the HackBio Internship! This repository highlights my journey through an intensive 8-week practical internship in oncology, focusing on machine learning and data science applications.
## Internship Overview:

The internship was divided into five progressive stages, covering a comprehensive range of activities aimed at building both theoretical and practical foundations in cancer research:
<ul><li> Stage 0:  Built theoretical foundations and wrote an essay on supervised learning's importance in cancer research. </li>
<li>Stage 1: Collaborated with a team to conduct a literature review, "Machine Learning for Lung Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis," and summarized our findings in a video. </li>
<li>Stage 2: Preprocessed Glioblastoma dataset from TCGA, performed differential expression analysis and pathway enrichment using ShinyGo, alongside Biomarker and ML interns.</li>
<li>Stage 3: Implemented a pipeline for potential Sarcoma biomarkers based on age classification using differential expression, functional enrichment, and ML models.</li>
<li>Stage 4: Reproduced research by clustering gene expression data for LGG glioma based on IDH status, using KNN. </li>
<li>Stage 5-7: Final Capstone Project</li></ul>

## Objectives
Throughout this internship, I achieved:

<ul><li>A deep understanding of supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches.</li>
<li>Hands-on experience in cancer biomarker discovery.</li>
<li>Practical skills in R programming, data visualization, and dataset analysis.</li>
<li>Collaboration with interdisciplinary teams, project management, and effective communication.</li></ul>
