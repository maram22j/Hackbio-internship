 With the emergence of AI and Machine learning and their consistent development over the years, it has become crucial to include them in the medical field.
So in this essay, we will attempt to answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What is Machine Learning? And what does the supervised method mean?</li>
<li>How has this method been applied in Cancer diagnosis?</li>
<li>What are the outcomes of using this method in the future?</li> </ul>

### Concept explanation: <a id="concept explanation"></a>
 Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on statistical tools to draw conclusions from data, enabling the prediction of a given phenomenon. It employs algorithms that are self-taught through exposure to data <!--[if supportFields]><span

As a subtype of machine learning, Supervised machine learning uses labelled datasets to train algorithms. Each algorithm in the dataset consists of input data and its related output labels. This method enables the latter to recognize patterns and relationships in the data based on the provided examples, resulting in more accurate predictions when applied to unknown data.

There are three steps: <!--[if supportFields]><span

1\. **_Training phase:_**  The algorithm is presented with labelled data to understand the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

 2 **_. Model building phase:_** involves generalizing the knowledge gained during the training phase.

 3. **_Prediction phase:_** The machine is able to predict new data.&#x20;

Actually, this method can be used to analyse genetic mutations to determine which targeted therapies are likely to be most effective or to predict how a patient might respond to a specific drug based on their genetic profile.
In addition, it can be used on magnetic resonance (MR) images to train the model to differentiate between malignant or benign ones \[1].
This technique is also used in cancer prediction and prognosis to determine a person's cancer risk. Algorithms such as KNN, decision tree algorithm, support vector machine learning are commonly used. For instance, an Egyptian study found that support vector machine is the most effective algorithm in predicting patients with lung cancer.<!--[if supportFields]><span

### Conclusion: <a id="conclusion"></a>
   Supervised learning become increasingly important since it has enhanced the progress of cancer diagnosis, analysis and personalized treatment. As it continues to develop, it will aid in the fight against this disease and bring novel treatments in the future.
